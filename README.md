# 2D_Data-to-3D_Migration

A Matlab code for predicting 3D cell migration from 2D data.

Developed by Daniel Camacho-Gomez, University of Zaragoza. E-mail: dcamacho@unizar.es danielcamachogomez@hotmail.com


# Description: 

Open the file "MainOPT.m", add the data from the experiments (several examples are provided), and run the code to start optimization. The results will be saved in the "Results" folder.

"migrationModel.m" contains the computational model.

Use "Postprocessing.m" to plot 3D trajectories.
